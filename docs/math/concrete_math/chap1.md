## 1x01. THE TOWER OF HANOI

$$
\begin{align}
    T_0 &= 0 \newline
    T_n &= 2T_{n - 1} + 1
\end{align}
$$

The Tower of Hanoi recurrence is typical of many that arise in applica-
tions of all kinds. In finding a closed-form expression for some quantity of
interest like $T_n$ we go through three stages:

1. Look at small cases. 
2. Find and prove a mathematical expression for the quantity of interest. 
3. Find and prove a closed form for our mathematical expression.
