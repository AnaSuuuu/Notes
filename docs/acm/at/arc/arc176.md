**Solution:**

  For a position $x$, if there exists $(x, y, k)$, $(x, z, k)$, then the position $x$ must be $k$.

  If there exists $(x, y, k_1)$, $(x, z, k_2)$ which satisfies $k_1 < k_2$, then the position $z$ must be $k$.

  So the breakthrough point must be the position which related to other position more than once.

  We can sort the connection by the value increasingly.

  For some value, its position either be determined or between two positions.

  We can find all these points and the rest number can be put in the sequence decreasingly.

  If the maximum among some positions isn't more than $x$, so the prospected positions for x should exclude these positions.

  We can find out all prospected positions for each of values and calculate the answer.
