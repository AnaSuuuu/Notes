### A. A Multiply

**Solution**

  If $C > 0$, find the $k_1$, which is the maximum of the subsum of `A`.

  If $C < 0$, find the $k_2$, which is the minimum of the subsum of `A`.

  Supposing the total sum of `A` is $S_a$, then the answer is $C \times (k_{1 / 2} - 1) + S_a$. 


### B. Bought Review

**Solution**

  It's obvious that only one review has the highest cost-effectiveness.

  So we just need to compare the review 4 and review 5, which to choose.



### C. 


### D. Digit vs Square Root

**Solution**

  To create a table, we can enumerate some of the smallest Ns and find that the experimental result below:

  ```
    [ 1 , 1 ]
    [ 80 , 80 ]
    [ 90 , 109 ]
    [ 9800 , 9800 ]
    [ 9900 , 10099 ]
    [ 998000 , 998000 ]
    [ 999000 , 1000999 ]
    [ 99980000 , 99980000 ]
    [ 99990000 , 100009999 ]
  ```

  So we can find the regular patterns of the results. And just to calculate it. 

  Don't forget to use `long long`. :)
