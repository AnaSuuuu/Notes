## [B. Make Many Triangles](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc173/tasks/arc173_b)

**Solution**

  If there exists a line containg more than k points, which satisfies that $2 \times (n - k) <= k$, so the answer is $n - k$.
    
  Otherwise the ans is $\dfrac{n}{3}$.

## [C. Not Median](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc173/tasks/arc173_c)

**Solution**

  If the i-th answer is very big, the condition may be either of them below.

    - + - + - + - + - 0 + - + - + - + - + -

    + - + - + - + - + 0 - + - + - + - + - +

  Supposing i-th answer is k, and for $j \in [i, i + k]$, the answer_j = $3$.

  Because it satisfies that $(a_j - a_{j - 1}) \times (a_j - a_{j + 1}) \ge 0$.

  And the final time complexity is O(n).

## [D. Bracket Walk](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc173/tasks/arc173_d)

**Solution**

  Let `(` be $1$, `)` be $-1$.

  If there exists a route that satisfies the total value is $0$, even it's illegal, we can also transform it into a valid parentheses string by circular shifting.

  For example, `)())((` can become `(()())` which is valid.

  So the problem is to find a route which involves all the edge and the sum is $0$.

  Obviously, if there exists a positive ring and a negative ring, there will be an answer. Moreover, if all the ring of the graph is neither positive not negative, it can also have an answer.
