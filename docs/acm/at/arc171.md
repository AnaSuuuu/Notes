### [B. Make Many Triangles](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc173/tasks/arc173_b)

**Solution**

  If there exists a line containg more than k points, which satisfies that $2 \times (n - k) <= k$, so the answer is $n - k$.
    
  Otherwise the ans is $\dfrac{n}{3}$.

### [C. Not Median](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc173/tasks/arc173_c)

**Solution**

  If the i-th answer is very big, the condition may be either of them below.

    - + - + - + - + - 0 + - + - + - + - + -

    + - + - + - + - + 0 - + - + - + - + - +

  Supposing i-th answer is k, and for $j \in [i, i + k]$, the answer_j = $3$.

  Because it satisfies that $(a_j - a_{j - 1}) \times (a_j - a_{j + 1}) \ge 0$.

  And the final time complexity is O(n).

### [D. Bracket Walk](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc173/tasks/arc173_d)

**Solution**

  Let `(` be $1$, `)` be $-1$.

  If there exists a route that satisfies the total value is $0$, even it's illegal, we can also transform it into a valid parentheses string by circular shifting.

  For example, `)())((` can become `(()())` which is valid.

  So the problem is to find a route which involves all the edge and the sum is $0$.

  Obviously, if there exists a positive ring and a negative ring, there will be an answer. Moreover, if all the ring of the graph is neither positive not negative, it can also have an answer.

### [A. A Multiply](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc174/tasks/arc174_a)

**Solution**

  If $C > 0$, find the $k_1$, which is the maximum of the subsum of `A`.

  If $C < 0$, find the $k_2$, which is the minimum of the subsum of `A`.

  Supposing the total sum of `A` is $S_a$, then the answer is $C \times (k_{1 / 2} - 1) + S_a$. 


### [B. Bought Review](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc174/tasks/arc174_b)

**Solution**

  It's obvious that only one review has the highest cost-effectiveness.

  So we just need to compare the review 4 and review 5, which to choose.



### [C. Catastrophic Roulette](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc174/tasks/arc174_c)

**Solution:**

  Good Probability DP.

  $F_i$ denotes that after choose i items, the expeted fine for the first people.

  $G_i$ denotes that after choose i items, the expected fine for the second people.

  (First people denotes the one who will choose the item this time.)

  Then we can get the transformation formula:

$$
\begin{align*}
    F_i &= (1 - \dfrac{i}{n})G_{i + 1} + \dfrac{i}{n}(G_i + 1)  \newline
    G_i &= (1 - \dfrac{i}{n})F_{i + 1} + \dfrac{i}{n}F_i
\end{align*}
$$

  $F_0$ and $G_0$ are the answers.


### [D. Digit vs Square Root](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc174/tasks/arc174_c)

**Solution**

  To create a table, we can enumerate some of the smallest Ns and find that the experimental result below:

  ```
    [ 1 , 1 ]
    [ 80 , 80 ]
    [ 90 , 109 ]
    [ 9800 , 9800 ]
    [ 9900 , 10099 ]
    [ 998000 , 998000 ]
    [ 999000 , 1000999 ]
    [ 99980000 , 99980000 ]
    [ 99990000 , 100009999 ]
  ```

  So we can find the regular patterns of the results. And just to calculate it. 

  Don't forget to use `long long`. :)

## [ARC176](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc176)

### [C. Max Permutation](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc176/tasks/arc176_c)

**Solution:**

  For a position $x$, if there exists $(x, y, k)$, $(x, z, k)$, then the position $x$ must be $k$.

  If there exists $(x, y, k_1)$, $(x, z, k_2)$ which satisfies $k_1 < k_2$, then the position $z$ must be $k$.

  So the breakthrough point must be the position which related to other position more than once.

  We can sort the connection by the value increasingly.

  For some value, its position either be determined or between two positions.

  We can find all these points and the rest number can be put in the sequence decreasingly.

  If the maximum among some positions isn't more than $x$, so the prospected positions for x should exclude these positions.

  We can find out all prospected positions for each of values and calculate the answer.
