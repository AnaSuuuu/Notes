### [D. Permutation Subsequence](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc352/tasks/abc352_d)

**Solution:**

We use array b to write down $a_i$'s position.

Then we just need to use sliding window technique to solve it. 

### [F. Estimate Order](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc352/tasks/abc352_f)

**Solution:**

DFS.

For a relationship between two points, we can enumerate all possible solutions.

The maximum complexity is $O(n(n - 2)(n - 4) .. 2)$.

Supposing many limitations, the factual complexity is much less than that.

### [G. Socks 3](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc352/tasks/abc352_g)

**Solution:**

Let $P(X = i)$ denotes the probability that the sockets fetched from first i times are different and that satisfies the condition at the (i + 1)-th time.

Then the answer is $1 + \sum_{i = 1}^{n} i \cdot P(X = i)$.

And we have the **Lemma** 

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} i \cdot P(X = i) = \sum_{i = 1}^n P(X \ge i)
$$

??? success "Proof"
    $$
        \begin{align*}
        \text{LHS} &= \sum_{i = 1}^n P(X = i)\sum_{j = 1}^i 1 \\
                   &= \sum_{j = 1}^n \sum_{i = j}^n P(X = i) \\
                   &= \sum_{i = 1}^n P(X \ge i) = \text{RHS}
        \end{align*}
    $$

And how to find the value of $P(X \ge i)$. 
$P(X \ge i)$ denotes the probability that the sockets fetched from first i times are different.

So we can find that:

$$
    P(X \ge i) = \dfrac{\sum_{b_1, b_2, ..., b_i}\prod_{j = 1}^{i} A_{b_j}}{\binom{S}{i}} 
$$

$S$ denotes the sum of $a_i$.

The number of numerator is $[x^k]\prod (1 + a_ix)$, we can use NTT tech by dividing and conquering to solve it.
