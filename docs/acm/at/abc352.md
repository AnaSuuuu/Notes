## [D. Permutation Subsequence](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc352/tasks/abc352_d)

**Solution:**

  We use array b to write down $a_i$'s position.

  Then we just need to use sliding window technique to solve it. 

## [F. Estimate Order](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc352/tasks/abc352_f)

**Solution:**

  DFS.

  For a relationship between two points, we can enumerate all possible solutions.

  The maximum complexity is $O(n(n - 2)(n - 4) .. 2)$.

  Supposing many limitations, the factual complexity is much less than that.
