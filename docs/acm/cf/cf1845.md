**Solution:**

  For the answer, only the last partition of the array is related to the answer.

  So how can we determine the position of the beginning of the last partition?

  We can just enumerate it. For the position i, if it's the beginning of the last partition, the answer is $k + S_n - S_i$.

  Number $k$ denotes the maximum number in the first i numbers. Array $S$ denotes the prefix sum of array $A$.

  So the answer must be the maximum element of the n numbers.
