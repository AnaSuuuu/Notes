**Solution:**

We can use 2-SAT tech to solve it.

If in a column, there are $-a, b$ and $c$.

Then we can know that 

1. if $a$ is $1$, $b$ must be $1$, $c$ must be $1$.
2. if $b$ is $-1$, $a$ must be $-1$, $c$ must be $1$.
3. if $c$ is $-1$, $b$ must be $1$, $a$ must be $-1$.

So we can get that:
$$
\begin{align}
    a \to b \text{  and   } a \to c \newline
    \neg b \to \neg a \text{  and   } \neg b \to c \newline
    \neg c \to b \text{  and   } \neg c \to \neg a \newline
\end{align}
$$

And for one single node we can split it into two nodes, recognized as $i$ and $i + n$.

So we can construct a graph demonstrate the logical relationship. 
If $i + n$ and $i$ are in the same SCC, then the answer is "NO", otherwise is "YES".

## [G. Yasya and the Mysterious Tree](https://codeforces.com/contest/1980/problem/G)

**Solution:**

For each query, $ans = f_{x, y} \oplus val = f_{x, root} \oplus f_{root, y} \oplus val$

So we should the max $f_{x, root}$, and we can use 01-trie to solve the problem.

For the modify operation, cause it changes all the edges, so only the node with odd distances can be changed.

We can maintain two 01-trie trees. One for the odd-distances nodes, the other for even-distances nodes.
