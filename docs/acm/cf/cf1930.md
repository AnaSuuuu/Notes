## [D2. Sum over all Substrings (Hard Version)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1930/D2)

**Solution:**

  Good problem.

  Suppose `dp[i][j]` denotes `f(s[i, j])`.

  For a fixed 01-string, we should put 1s greedily. In other word, if we put a `1`, then it should be `0101`.
  And not hard to find that this tragedy of putting 1 is most optimal.

  So the transition may be:

  ```
    if(s[i] == '1') dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i + 3][j] (i, i + 1, i + 2 should be '010')
    else dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
  ```

  But the complexity is $O(n^2)$.To we need further optimization.

  Suppose `F[i]` denotes $\sum dp[i][j]$.

  If `s[i] = '0'`:

  $$
  \begin{align}
  F[i] = \sum_{j = i}^{n} dp[i][j] &= dp[i][i] + \sum_{j = i}^{n}dp[i][j] \newline
      &= dp[i][i] + \sum_{j = i + 1}^{n} dp[i][j] \newline
      &= dp[i][i] + \sum_{j = i + 1}^{n} dp[i + 1][j] \newline
      &= 0 + F[i + 1] = F[i + 1]
  \end{align}
  $$

  If `s[i] = '1'`:

  $$
  \begin{align}
  F[i] = \sum_{j = i}^{n} 1 + dp[i + 3][j] &= n - i + 1 + \sum_{j = i}^{n} dp[i + 3][j] \newline
      &= n - i + 1 + \sum_{j = i + 3}^{n} dp[i + 3][j] \newline
      &= n - i + 1 + F[i + 3]
  \end{align}
  $$

  So we can solve the problem with the complexity of $O(n)$.
