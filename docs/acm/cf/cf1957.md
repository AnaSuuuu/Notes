## [C. How Does the Rook Move?](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1957/C)

**Solution:**

  Fucking counting problem. Too stupid to solve it. QwQ

  Let $f_n$ denote the answer when there are n rows and n columns available.

  Because there must be rooks in the first column and first row, so we can only consider how to choose for first column and first row to avoid repeat.

  If we choose $(1, 1)$, then the answer equates to $f_{n - 1}$.

  Otherwise, we can choose any position in the first row and first column except $(1, 1)$. 
  And there are $2n - 2$ choices.

  So $\forall n > 1, f_n = f_{n - 1} + (2n - 2)f_{n - 2}$.
  
  And don't forget $f_0 = f_1 = 1$.


## [D. A BIT of an Inequality](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1957/D)

**Solution:**

  Let $S_i = a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus ... \oplus a_i$, so the problem is $S_z \oplus S_{x - 1} \oplus a_y > S_z \oplus S_{x - 1}$.

  If the highest bit of $a_i$ is k, then we can know that $S_z \oplus S_{x - 1} >> k$ must be $0$.

  So either $S_{z} >> k = 1 \wedge S_{x - 1} >> k = 1$ or $S_{z} >> k = 0 \wedge S_{x - 1} >> k = 0$,
  and we just need to write down how many 1s in the prefix array $S$ at the bit of k.
