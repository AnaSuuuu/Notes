### [E. Count Paths](https://codeforces.com/contest/1923/problem/E)

**Solution:**
  
For each node, we just need to count the contribution it can match except the nodes in its subtree.

$cnt_{c_i}$ denotes the numbers that $c_i$ can match except i's subtree.

When we dfs the subtree, $cnt_{c_i}$ initially is $1$, when we iterate other subtress, it becomes the previous $cnt_{c_i}$ plus $1$.

### [D2. Sum over all Substrings (Hard Version)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1930/D2)

**Solution:**

Good problem.

Suppose `dp[i][j]` denotes `f(s[i, j])`.

For a fixed 01-string, we should put 1s greedily. In other word, if we put a `1`, then it should be `0101`.
And not hard to find that this tragedy of putting 1 is most optimal.

So the transition may be:

```
if(s[i] == '1') dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i + 3][j] (i, i + 1, i + 2 should be '010')
else dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
```

But the complexity is $O(n^2)$.To we need further optimization.

Suppose `F[i]` denotes $\sum dp[i][j]$.

If `s[i] = '0'`:

$$
\begin{align}
  F[i] = \sum_{j = i}^{n} dp[i][j] &= dp[i][i] + \sum_{j = i}^{n}dp[i][j] \newline
      &= dp[i][i] + \sum_{j = i + 1}^{n} dp[i][j] \newline
      &= dp[i][i] + \sum_{j = i + 1}^{n} dp[i + 1][j] \newline
      &= 0 + F[i + 1] = F[i + 1]
\end{align}
$$

If `s[i] = '1'`:

$$
\begin{align}
F[i] = \sum_{j = i}^{n} 1 + dp[i + 3][j] &= n - i + 1 + \sum_{j = i}^{n} dp[i + 3][j] \newline
    &= n - i + 1 + \sum_{j = i + 3}^{n} dp[i + 3][j] \newline
    &= n - i + 1 + F[i + 3]
\end{align}
$$

So we can solve the problem with the complexity of $O(n)$.
