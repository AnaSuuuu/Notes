## [D. Buying Jewels](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1951/D)

**Solution:**

  If $n - k + 1 > k - 1$, we can buy one jewel in the first stall, and $k - 1$ in the second.
  And the first price is $n - k + 1$, the second is $1$.

  If $n - k + 1 \le k - 1$, then $n \le 2k - 2$. So $n < 2k$. 
  So we can only set the price of stall to be $1$, and in this condition, only when `n == k` can have the answer.

## [E. No Palindromes](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1951/E)

**Solution:**

  If there is a solution, we can split the string into $1$ or $2$ partitions.

  Otherwise, there's no answer.

  Just understand sensitively. :)
