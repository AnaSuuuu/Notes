### B. Non-Palindromic Substring

**Solution:**

  If a string is not k-th good, the all substring of length k is palindromic.

  So [i ... j] and [i + 1 ... j + 1] is palindromic.

  And in that case, if k is odd, we can know that 

  $$
    a_i = a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 2} = ... = a_j
  $$

  If k is even, we can know that,

  $$
    a_i = a_{i + 2} = a_{i + 4} = ... \\
    a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 3} = a_{i + 5} = ...
  $$

  So we can find out that:

  1. k = 1: never possible
  2. 1 < k < n, odd: not an alternating string
  3. 1 < k < n, even: not all characters same
  4. k = n: non-palindromic string
