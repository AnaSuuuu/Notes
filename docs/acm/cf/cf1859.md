**Solution:**

  Good problem.

  First we should observe that we'd better move to $b_i$.

  The proof seems to be obvious, if a segment don't cover $b_i$, then it's right point must be less than $b_i$.

  $kdl_i$ denote that the optimum answer starting from the segment $i$.

  For every query $x_i$, $ans_i = \max\{x_i, \max_{j = 1}^{n}kdl_j|l_j \le x_i \le r_j\}$.

  So we can use scanline method from the end to solve this problem, for each query, we just should teleport to the max available $b_i$.
