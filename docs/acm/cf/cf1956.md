## [C. Nene's Magical Matrix](https://codeforces.com/contest/1956/problem/C)

**Solution:**

  We can find the answer is like

  ```
    n = 3

    1 2 3
    2 2 3
    3 3 3

    n = 4

    1 2 3 4
    2 2 3 4
    3 3 3 4
    4 4 4 4

    n = 5

    1 2 3 4 5
    2 2 3 4 5
    3 3 3 4 5
    4 4 4 4 5
    5 5 5 5 5
    ...
  ```

  And it's not hard to find the rule. So we can solve it.


## [D. Nene and the Mex Operator](https://codeforces.com/contest/1956/problem/D)

**Solution:**

  We can use DP to find the answer and track from the end to the front to figure how to split the array.

  Once we knew the division, we can use divide and conquer to print the answer.
